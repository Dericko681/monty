This is an advanced project in my alxx journey in which
1)I will implement the push and pall opcodes.
2)implemetn the print opcode,
3)Implement the pop opcode.

The pop opcode

The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.

Usage: pop
If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pop an empty stack, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
4)Implement the swap opcode.

The swap opcode

The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.

Usage: swap
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't swap, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
5)Implement the add opcode.

The add opcode

The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.

Usage: add
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't add, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter
And handle 14 other advanced tasks.
